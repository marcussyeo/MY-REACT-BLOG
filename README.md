# Installation Guide for Create-React-App

You need to install the latest version of react (Delete create-react-app if you have installed it globally in order to ensure you have the latest version)

```
npm uninstall -g create-react-app

npm install create-react-app && create-react-app React_js
```

When developers commit their code onto github, sometimes they leave out the node_modules package due to it's large package size. To reinstall the node_modules again, you can run the following code in the terminal:

```
npm install
```

## Running the App

```
npm run start
```
